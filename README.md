# Rothko-Inspired Painting with HTML & CSS

This is a project that recreates the look and feel of a Mark Rothko painting—just using HTML and CSS. It’s a simple, abstract piece made up of three blurred color blocks arranged inside a dark canvas with a bold black frame.

## What’s in This Project

- `index.html` – The structure of the page.
- `styles.css` – All the styling that brings the painting to life.

## What It Does

This project simulates a Rothko-style artwork using only code. It layers colored blocks with subtle rotation, shadows, and blur effects to give a soft, painterly texture—no images or graphics involved. It’s all done with pure HTML and CSS.

## How to Run It

1. Download or clone the repository to your computer.
2. Make sure both `index.html` and `styles.css` are in the same folder.
3. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
4. The page will automatically load the CSS and display your Rothko-style painting.

## Built With

- **HTML5** for the structure
- **CSS3** for all the styling, shadows, blur, and transforms

## Design Details

Here are a few techniques used to create the visual effect:

- `box-shadow` adds a glowing, soft edge to the shapes
- `border-radius` creates organic, rounded corners
- `transform: rotate()` gives each block a slightly imperfect, hand-painted feel
- `filter: blur()` adds softness and simulates the blending of paint

## Project Source

This was created as part of the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) **Responsive Web Design** certification.  
It’s one of the projects in the CSS section, designed to help you practice layout and visual design using only code.
